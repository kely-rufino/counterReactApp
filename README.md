# counterReactApp
App made to show the abilities using React, button and state.
The first part of this project was create a counter whith two buttons:
one that when click on the button (+) will add one number and when click in the button(-)it will substract one number.
The second part I made a button that when clicked  multiply the number for 3, starting with 1.
