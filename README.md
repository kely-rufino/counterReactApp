# counterReactApp
App made to show the abilities using React, button and State.
The first part of this project was create a counter whith two buttons, one when I click on the button + will add one number and when I click in the button - it will substract one number.

The second part I made a button that when clicked I multiply the number for 3, starting with 1.
